Feature: Pagination, Filters, and Advanced Search (Phase 3)
  As a CS2 skin buyer
  I want professional pagination, filtering, and search capabilities
  So that I can efficiently browse large item catalogs and find specific skins

  Background:
    Given the CS Loadout application is running
    And I am on the homepage with item grid displayed
    And Phase 1 (Enhanced Navigation) is complete
    And Phase 2 (Professional Item Display) is complete

  # ============================================================
  # PAGINATION CONTROLS
  # ============================================================

  Scenario: Professional pagination controls display correctly
    Given I have more than 20 items to display
    When I view the item grid
    Then I should see pagination controls below the grid
    And I should see "Previous" button on the left
    And I should see "Next" button on the right
    And I should see page numbers between buttons
    And pagination should use gray-800 background with rounded-lg
    And buttons should have hover effects (hover:bg-gray-700)
    And pagination should be horizontally centered

  Scenario: Current page is visually distinct
    Given I am viewing page 2 of items
    Then page number "2" should have csgo-orange background
    And page number "2" should have white text color
    And page number "2" should have font-bold styling
    And other page numbers should have gray-700 background
    And other page numbers should have gray-300 text color

  Scenario: Previous button behavior
    Given I am on page 3 of items
    When I click the "Previous" button
    Then I should navigate to page 2
    And the item grid should update with page 2 items
    And scroll position should reset to grid top
    And page number "2" should be highlighted

  Scenario: Previous button is disabled on first page
    Given I am on page 1 of items
    Then the "Previous" button should be disabled
    And the "Previous" button should have opacity-50 styling
    And the "Previous" button should have cursor-not-allowed
    And clicking "Previous" should not navigate

  Scenario: Next button behavior
    Given I am on page 1 of items
    And there are multiple pages available
    When I click the "Next" button
    Then I should navigate to page 2
    And the item grid should update with page 2 items
    And scroll position should reset to grid top
    And page number "2" should be highlighted

  Scenario: Next button is disabled on last page
    Given I am on the last page of items
    Then the "Next" button should be disabled
    And the "Next" button should have opacity-50 styling
    And the "Next" button should have cursor-not-allowed
    And clicking "Next" should not navigate

  Scenario: Direct page number navigation
    Given I am on page 1 of items
    And I can see page numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    When I click page number "4"
    Then I should navigate directly to page 4
    And the item grid should update with page 4 items
    And page number "4" should be highlighted
    And scroll position should reset to grid top

  Scenario: Page number truncation for many pages
    Given there are more than 7 pages of items
    And I am on page 5
    Then I should see: [1, ..., 4, 5, 6, ..., last]
    And ellipsis should be non-clickable
    And ellipsis should use gray-500 color
    And first and last page should always be visible

  Scenario: Items per page configuration
    Given pagination is configured for 20 items per page
    Then each page should show exactly 20 items
    And the last page should show remaining items (1-20)
    And total pages should be calculated correctly
    And page count should display: "Page X of Y"

  # ============================================================
  # SKELETON LOADERS FOR LOADING STATES
  # ============================================================
